<h2> Drug hurts family <h2>
<p>
When family members take drugs:

You can't count on them to do what they say they will do.
They may forget or get distracted because their focus is on getting and taking drugs.
They might lie or steal money to buy drugs.
They might get fired from their jobs.
They might not come home at night.
They may do bad things they would never do if they weren't using drugs.
Family members might fight a lot because of the problems the drug use is causing. The person who is using drugs might do and say things that upset neighbors and friends, and make the family ashamed.</p>
