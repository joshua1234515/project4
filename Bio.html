<h1>Biography<h1>
<h2>Dana Plato<h2>
<p>
Bankrupt and addicted to prescription drugs, Plato spiraled out of control. She moved to Las Vegas, hoping to advance her career, but could only find retail and service industry jobs. In 1991, at the height of her desperation, she held up a local video store with a pellet gun, grabbing less than $200 from the register. She was nabbed by police only minutes later, and was bailed out of prison by Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton. She was let off easy, facing no jail time and only five years of probation. Plato violated the terms of her probation, however, by forging prescriptions for Valium. The judge sentenced Plato to 30 days in jail, followed by a drug rehab program.
But rehab didn't take for Plato, who died of an overdose on May 8, 1999, at age 34.
